        <h3>
          A Phoenix Down refers to the mythical creature's down feathers, the undercoat of feathers underneath the visible layer on top.
          The Phoenix is depicted in many mythologies to be a magical creature that can return itself to life from its own ashes upon its death, and so its feathers
          are seen as a means to heal wounds, soothe spirits, and even return the dead back to life as a Phoenix itself does. We hope the drinks available
          from our website can do just as much as a phoenix down can do for you.
